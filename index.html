                <p>
                        I, as I said above, am currently learning HTML. This is also why I'm coding this website. I am learning this on a website called <strong> Codeacademy</strong> . A lot of their Stuff is free, although for Projects and Quizzes you need a Membership which is expensive. This is why I'm doing my own project! ;)
                        I'm learning hacking on two websites, which are <strong> Hack The Box Accademy </strong> (HTB) and <strong> Try Hack Me </strong> (THM). I started on Try Hack Me, but have gotten to the point where I have to jump lots of modules because there not free and it just isnt worth it anymore. I will likley get a Membership soon though. In Hack The Box I havent run into this problem yet, although I haven't been using it for long.
